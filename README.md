## Te Hotumanawa A Horomona Nga Morehu Elkington

I am an energetic, ambitious and inquisitive **Junior Full Stack Developer**, looking for a role where I can consolidate
and extend my programming knowledge.

After finishing High School I worked for a pizzeria company for three years. While working for the pizzeria I attended
WINTEC(*polytechnic*) gaining a New Zealand Certificate in Cookery (Level 3). 
Deciding to push myself further, I moved to Japan. There I met a great chef who inspired me to work in Michelin starred
restaurants. With a hunger to go further, I moved to London to really throw myself in the deep end
and work in a Michelin starred restaurant (*Ametsa with Arzark instructions*).

2020 was a tough year for everyone, especially for those in the hospitality industry. Finding myself furloughed and with a ton of time on my hands, I decided to occupy my time by learning to code. What attracted me to coding was the problem solving aspect and the idea of being able to build anything you want. The concept of being able to create anything you can imagine is, to me, on the same plane as being an explorer in an old world, there is so much to discover and explore. The only thing holding you back is how hungry you are to explore!

### Skills

#### Attention to detail

During my time as a chef, having an extreme attention to detail is a must-have. This comes into play everyday as everything must be to a high standard and be consistent with what the Head Chef wants (*and also being proud of what you are serving to clients*). This has been extremely useful everyday, especially when catering for large groups when everything must taste and be presented the same.

This has helped me in writing high quality code, spotting potential bug causing code and quickly identifying the solution to bugs when they do occur.

#### Excellent communicator

During my time as a chef, I've learned how to communicate in high intensity, fast-paced environments, clearly and efficiently.
This has been especially challenging at times where I may have been the only person in the kitchen to speak english.
Where every second counts, I must be able to communicate clearly with other team members. Working in these stressful situations has given me the tools to be able to communicate other team members excellently.

Having excellent communication has been a life saver here at makers. In my final project tension was running high, ideas clashing and everyone feeling stressed in general. My communication with the other team members to come to a compromise was essential for us to have a final project to show off and be proud of the product we had built.

#### Thrives under pressure

Working in kitchens is always high intensity, high pressure. There is always small time frames for when tasks have to be done by, multiple things to think about. Great communication, organisational skills, the ability to learn quickly and time management skills that I have developed
as a chef allow me to thrive under pressure.

This was great for my time at Makers and especially for the team project where we had to build [Facebook clone](https://github.com/danroche10/acebook-it-does-not-node-well) in two weeks, with none of us having any prior knowledge of Node and minimal JavaScript experience,
we were able to produce a product we were all proud of. 

#### Fast learner

From knowing nothing about commercial cooking to working for a Michelin starred restaurant, I've always had to learn quickly.
While working for the pizzeria, my bosses opened a new location and I was asked to run it. This was both an exciting and nerve wracking
opportunity. I had to learn how to manage staff, deliveries, stock, all on top of the day to day operations. If things went wrong
it was up to me solve the problem.

My first time leaving New Zealand was to Japan. I didn't know the language, culture or anything about fine dining.
Everyday I would learn a little more Japanese to be able to communicate with the team effectively on top of learning to cook in a 
different environment with many new things.

Working in a Michelin starred restaurant was the toughest challenge. Everything in these kitchens changes rapidly, menu, staff, ingredients,
sections. As soon as you become proficient in a section you are put on another section to learn the ins and outs of it on top of communicating
with staff that either spoke little english or only spanish.

This has been the most important skill for me and my time at Makers. Being able to quickly grasp concepts and use the relevant information to build projects to a high standard and be proud of them.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (July, '21 - October, '21)

A 16-week intensive development boot camp, focusing on :
- Agile methodologies - I was frequently required to work in an agile manner attending Makers. This was vital for planning sprints and attending stand ups to further the various projects I worked on.
- Object-oriented design
- Test driven development and behaviour driven development - One of the main focuses for Makers Academy is TDD and BDD. Learning to code in this manner helps to stop over engineering code and makes sure I understand exactly what I'm building and why I'm building it a certain way.
- Pair programming - Over the course you are required to pair with someone everyday. This builds interpersonal skills, teaches patience, teach or learn something new from your pair and gives you an insight to how other people think (*it may sound obvious, but not everyone thinks like you*).
- Ruby, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine, Jest
